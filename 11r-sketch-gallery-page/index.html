  <p id="title1">IMAGINARY CREATURE </p>
  <p id="desc">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
  <p id="text">This project depicts a scene in which the fairy serves as the focal point for the viewer ascribed to its close positioning. Their eyes are immediately captured by the essence of the moon, along with its reflection, due to their striking colourful qualities. The immobility of the sea and the sky serve to further highlight the moonâ€™s movement, and contrasts its importance in the piece. It establishes a relationship between the two main figures of the image, the fairy and the moon. The ambience created is one of a calm and eery nature, willing the outsider to relax the view.</p>
